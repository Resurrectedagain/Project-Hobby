    <h1>Project Hobby</h1>
    <p>
        Books are food for brain, I was first introduced to reading by my mother
        , she used to read mystery novels in Urdu. I started reading novellas from very early age myself.
        I would buy them from a local shop 1Rupee for each novella and by the time I was 10, I had assembled a small library already. These days
        i buy most of my books from <a href="www.amazon.com">

  <h2> Types of books </h2>
  <p>
    As a kid i throughlly enjoyed mystery and magic books which to this day
    are one of my favourite genras. 
    In addition to mystery, magic and science fiction, i also enjoy different areas of self help books
    such as brain sceinces, energy, philosophy.

    Any reader will tell you that this is an extremely difficult question to answer, especailly when you read 
    so many different genras. But after alot of thinking and reflection, I consider Mistborn saga by Brandon Sanderson to be my favourite book. 
     The main character vin is extremely inspring along with all the other amazing concepts that Brandon Sanderson brings together. </p>

    My current habit is to read five books at a time which consist of one book on mind sciences which can be like learning a skill or improving 
    a certain part of brain,secondly i always read a book on energy and sprituality, third one has to be a mystery or fiction book to keep the element of suspense, fourth book is based , pyschology, 
    neurology and the role of A.I within the field. Final book can be about many different topics such as faith, philosophy, finance or economics.
     I might review these in futrue but as of now i feel comofortable with this pattern. The current books that I am reading 
    are the following
    1- Tiny Habits by B.G Fogg
    2- Own your energy by Alla Svirinskya
    3- Never by Ken Follen
    4- Mountain is you by Briana Wiest
    5- Secrets of divine love by A.halwa.
